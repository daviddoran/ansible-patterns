# Server Density Agent

This pattern installs the [Server Density](http://www.serverdensity.com/) monitoring agent.

To install the agent:

- define your server density credentials (in your main playbook, as demonstrated in `example-playbook.yml`)
- edit `server-density-agent.cfg.j2` to customize your monitoring agent setup *
- run the playbook on your selected servers

\* Tip: You can create variables for the custom settings you add to `server-density-agent.cfg.j2` (e.g. MySQL / MongoDB) if the configuration varies by server.
